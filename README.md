# SBoards
The Minestom Scoreboard api is not very good if you want to make a scoreboard that is different for each player.
<br> So i made this easy to use api wich also contains a simple global scoreboard
<br>
<br><br>
This api is inspired by [JScoreboards](https://github.com/JordanOsterberg/JScoreboards)
<br><br>
To use this api, shade it into your project<br>
By [downloading the jar](https://github.com/sqcred/SBoards/releases/latest)  or using maven
